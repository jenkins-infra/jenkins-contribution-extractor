	Short: "A brief description of your command",
	Long: `This command will get the list of comments
	(author and month) from GitHub for a given PR . 
	
	The PR is specified as "organization/project/PR number".
	
	The output is a CVS file, specified with the "-o"/"--out" parameter. If not
	defined it will take the default output filename.
	Each record of the output contains the following information:
	- PR specification
	- Commenter's login name
	- The month the comment was created (YYYY-MM)
	
	The behavior can be controlled with various flags, such as appending to an existing
	output file or overwriting it, header of no-header.
	
	This query requires authenticated API call. The GitHub Token (Personal Access Token) is
	retrieved from an environment variable (default is "GITHUB_TOKEN" but can be overridden with a flag)`,

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// prCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// prCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
